**Answer 1:**

- Kafka Node is responsible to store topics: **Correct** 

In Kafka, a topic is partitioned and replicated across multiple Kafka brokers (nodes), and each node is responsible for storing some of the partitions for each topic.

- Retention configuration ensures the messages not get lost over a specific period of time: **Correct**

Kafka has a retention configuration that determines how long messages are retained in a topic before they are deleted. This ensures that messages are not lost and can be replayed by consumers.

- Group-Id ensures the messages are distributed to associated consumers: **Correct** 

In Kafka, consumers can be organized into consumer groups, and each group has a unique group ID. Messages published to a topic are distributed to all consumer groups that are subscribed to that topic, and each group receives a subset of the messages.

- Zookeeper is removed from Kafka cluster starting from version 4.0: **Incorrect** 

ZooKeeper is still a critical component of the Kafka ecosystem and is used for storing metadata about brokers, topics, partitions, and consumer groups.


**Answer 2:**

The concepts that support reliability and availability in Kafka are: 
- Topic Replication
- Topic Partitioning


Consumer Group Id is used to group multiple consumers together for load balancing and fault tolerance, but it doesn't directly support reliability or availability. Ack All is not a Kafka concept.

**Answer 3:**

The concepts that support scaling in Kafka are:
- Topic Replication
- Topic Partitioning
- Consumer Group Id

Ack All is not a Kafka concept.

**Answer 4:**

For partitioning key, it's recommended to choose fields with high cardinality to avoid skewness and ensure even distribution of data across partitions. Based on the given options, the good candidates for partitioning key are:

**Good Candidates:**
- vendor_id
- tpep_pickup_datetime
- tpep_dropoff_datetime

**Not Good Candidates:**
- payment_type and passenger_count may have low cardinality, resulting in uneven data distribution across partitions. 
- total_amount may have high cardinality, but it's not a good candidate for partitioning key due to its wide range of values, which could lead to uneven partition sizes and potential performance issues.

**Answer 5:**

The configurations that should be provided for Kafka Consumer but not needed for Kafka Producer are:

Deserializer Configuration
Topics Subscription
Group-Id
Offset
Bootstrap Server is needed for both Kafka Consumer and Kafka Producer to connect to the Kafka cluster.

Cluster Key and Cluster-Secret are not related to Kafka Consumer or Kafka Producer configurations.
